Dear David
I've included two css html javascript examples (final.html & exampleB.html).
Both html documents contain a sample user input form.
Accompanied with the javascript input validator (val.js). 
I've also added some other javascript functions to the html pages such as
a popup box/confirmation box.

*Note I wanted to see If I could develope a dynamic web page that will scale
according to screen size. The orginal layout (background) was produced via an online 
tutorial. I add the images, forms, pop ups, and additional javascript functions.
